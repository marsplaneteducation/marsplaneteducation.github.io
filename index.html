				<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
					E-Guard Keylogger Detector combats keylogging software by monitoring all running
					applications, targeting those attempting to communicate
					through popular SMTP ports for Gmail, Yahoo, ATT, Microsoft, and AOL for both
					Windows and Linux machines. This software will run
					uninterrupted in the background while the device runs so that workflow can
					proceed as normal. Once the software has targeted an application
					that is communicating through specific SMTP ports, the process will be paused,
					and the user will be notified of the potential threat.
					Then, the user will be asked if this process should be added to a trusted
					whitelist to continue running as normal or kill the process
					immediately and be added to a blacklist so that any other time this process is
					running it will be automatically terminated.

				<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
					I began by completing and refining lab documents on various cybersecurity
					topics,
					including data anonymization, virtual switches and bridges, network
					virtualization
					with Open vSwitch and Linux Bridge, OpenFlow software, SDN controllers, Overlay
					Network protocols,
					Network Intrusion Detection Systems, system and network vulnerabilities (using
					Nmap), TCP/IP security,
					firewall configurations, and VPN basics.
					<br>
					After several weeks of debugging, I partnered with another Research Assistant to
					rebuild these documents
					using Sphinx. We converted .docx files to reStructuredText, using bash scripts
					for efficiency. This
					transformation provided a cohesive format with improved graphics and syntax.
					<br>
					Following the project's completion and peer review, we helped teach and present
					these lab documents to students
					during a week-long workshop. Acting as Teaching Assistants to the leading
					professor, we supported participants
					with understanding and applying the material.

				<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">
					The materials in this project were originally developed by Catalyzing Computing
					and Cybersecurity in
					Community Colleges (C5) project and contained PowerPoint presentations with
					corresponding lab documents
					that instructs beginner programmers how to write secure code and robust Python
					code.
					<br>
					This project was created originally using Python 2 and specifically for Linux.
					I, along with two other Research Assistants
					were tasked with updating the PowerPoints, lab documents, and solutions to
					Python 3 as well as creating both
					Linux and Windows friendly versions.
					<br>
					Once our task was completed and our work had been peer reviewed, our updated
					project was presented to a group of students,
					with no prior coding experience, attending a university in California for a week
					long workshop to get a peek inside the world of coding
					and cyber security. Myself and the two other Research Assistants participated as
					Teaching Assistants in this event, helping
					students one on one and as a group to ensure if somebody was behind and needed
					help or a further explanation of the lecture.

					Technology has always been something that’s both fascinated and terrified me since I was young, like
					how I learned not trust everything
					that can be downloaded on the internet. My favorite video game growing up was RuneScape where I
					could adventure online with my friends
					running around an open world, exploring, training my skills, killing dragons, and even other
					players. The problem was, I wasn’t very good,
					and I didn't have the patience to earn gold myself to become a better player. As a naive kid looking
					for an easy way out, I quickly found
					internet tools that promised to make my character rich beyond my wildest dreams with one click. How
					lucky, I thought, I was to be one of
					the only people to know about this! Without question, I downloaded it and after entering my username
					and password into this magical application,
					I sat and waited as I began to write down all the ways I wanted to spend my gold. Unfortunately, the
					gold never came as I was soon kicked offline,
					had my items stolen, and was left with a sinking feeling in my stomach thinking how I was so easily
					manipulated.
					<br><br>
					As I grew into adulthood, my passion for technology grew and I was eventually hired with a cable
					company as an installation and repair
					technician where I trained growing my skills in a professional environment. I started at the bottom,
					no prior work experience, only this passion
					I've held onto since I was young. It soon became abundantly clear I would need to put in more effort
					than I ever had before, as the competition
					was tough, and the success rate was low. Not only was the material challenging, but I also struggled
					to learn how to carry the equipment,
					in particular a 32-foot extension ladder. Admittedly, I’m not the strongest nor tallest guy in the
					world, so using brute force wasn’t an option.
					Instead, I had to master the proper technique, failing many times along the way, even being told by
					my training supervisors I should reconsider
					if this is something I want to pursue. I pushed myself beyond what I thought I was capable of and
					graduated top of the class, earning some of the
					highest scores for performance. Eventually, after more time and dedication to perfecting my work, I
					was promoted to lead technician and was
					responsible for training new hires for 90 days. I was the person my team members relied on for help
					or advise, and that was an amazing feeling.
					After a few years of hard work, I found myself at the top of my current position, unable to progress
					further without a higher education.
					For me, school had never been something I prioritized, or put much effort into. Looking back, I saw
					my perseverance in all of the times I was
					told I couldn’t do something. Not only was I able accomplish my goals but became one of the best at
					and taught others my methods. I realized what
					I’m capable of, and since then I’ve began at UTC in Summer 2019. I’ve consistently been awarded a
					Dean’s List participant each semester, an
					achievement I’ve never held in my academic life. What I study is my true passion, and I realize now
					more than ever my full potential and what
					I can accomplish when I put my mind to it.

					I’m a huge nature enthusiast and spend a good amount of my free time exploring new trails or going
					to the park with my wife and dog.
					Chattanooga is an amazing city for this kind of lifestyle where we are able to explore nearly
					endless amounts of hiking trails filled with
					beautiful scenery right next to downtown where we find great spots to eat or drink with friends and
					family.
					<br><br>
					When the weather doesn’t permit us to be out for long, or at all, I keep myself entertained inside
					by reading books on technology or space
					innovation, Chasing New Horizons as of lately which describes in stunning detail the New Horizon
					satellite that launched mid-2015 to
					explore Pluto and the Kepler belt. I also enjoy playing open-world video games such as RuneScape
					still as well as more recent titles such
					as Red Dead Redemption 2.
